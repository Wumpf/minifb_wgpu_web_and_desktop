xtask for `minifb_wgpu_web_and_desktop`
=======================================

This is a xtask crate for easily running the `minifb_wgpu_web_and_desktop` on the web.

It is a stripped down version of the one used in the [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) repository,
plus running wasm-opt on release builds.
